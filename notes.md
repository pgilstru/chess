## Phase 3 Notes

Inside of server/src/main/java/Main.java in the main method, create a Server object, and then call run on it. The run method needs the port you will run your server on, which typically for testing is 8080. When you run the main method it will start the server. Intelij will give you several lines of red text, but if the last line says 'started' then the server is active.
